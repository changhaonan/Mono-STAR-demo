# Mono-STAR: Mono-camera Scene-level Tracking and Reconstruction

## Overview

We present \emph{Mono-STAR}, the first real-time 3D reconstruction system  that simultaneously supports semantic fusion, fast motion tracking, non-rigid object deformation, and topological change under a unified framework.
The proposed system solves a new optimization problem that incorporates  optical-flow-based 2D constraints to deal with fast motion, and a novel semantic-aware deformation graph (SAD-graph) for handling topology change. We test the proposed system under various challenging scenes and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art systems.
